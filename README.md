# Description

In this project, I simulated a fictional processor design and architecture using Java. The goal was to implement a pipelined processor with a specific instruction set architecture and memory architecture. The project involved creating a program in assembly language, parsing, and storing instructions in the memory, and executing them according to the pipelined execution model.
